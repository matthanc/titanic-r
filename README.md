# Exploring the Titanic Dataset with R
The project script explores the Titanic Dataset with R. The goal of the project was to use machie learning to predict whether a passenger will survive the crash, considering the passenger data provided (i.e., name, age, cabin info, fare, etc.). Much of the passenger data is hidden in other variables and/or missing altogether.
